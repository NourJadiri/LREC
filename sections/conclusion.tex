\section{Conclusion}

We addressed a Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification challenge using LLMs by introducing Agora, a multi-agent ensemble framework that leverages consensus-based voting to transform unreliable single-agent classification into a robust decision process. Our experiments  revealed three key findings: (1) naive single-pass LLM baselines are outperformed by sophisticated architectures, (2) Actor-Critic self-refinement can introduce noise and degrade performance due to critic unreliability, and (3) Agora with 3-agent voting delivers substantial performance gains across all languages, achieving the best results in Hindi and competitive top-tier performance overall. 
This validates our main claim: multi-agent ensembling through consensus is a practical and effective method for building robust zero-shot classification systems. As NLP increasingly relies on powerful but imperfect LLMs, frameworks prioritizing reliability through consensus will be essential for trustworthy and deployable solutions.
